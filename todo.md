## Stripe Payment System (Admin Dashboard + /lp/hrt2)

- [x] Database schema: `stripe_settings` and `payments` tables created and migrated

- [x] Admin dashboard: `/admin/settings` — Stripe key management (test/live toggle, key entry)
- [x] Admin dashboard: payments tab with all payment records
- [x] Stripe Elements integration: `StripePaymentForm.tsx` replaces mock card form in LpConsultationModal2
- [x] GHL webhooks preserved unchanged in LpConsultationModal2
- [x] All 11 vitest tests passing
- [x] Promote owner user to admin role in database — auto-assigned on first login via upsertUser (OWNER_OPEN_ID check)
- [x] Scheduled $149 charge: Heartbeat cron job to charge remaining balance on appointment date
  - /api/scheduled/charge-remaining Express handler (server/scheduledChargeHandler.ts)
  - scheduleRemainingCharge tRPC mutation creates Heartbeat cron at 09:00 UTC on appointment date
  - Handler mounted in server/_core/index.ts before tRPC middleware
  - scheduledChargePaymentCronTaskUid column added to payments table

- [x] tRPC router: superAdmin.logout mutation
- [x] tRPC router: superAdmin.me query (session check)
- [x] Build /admin/login page with email/password form

## Brand Ambassador Page Design Refinements

- [x] Global: subtle dot-grid or gradient texture on #F9F9F9 sections, 80-100px section padding, body text #444444
