const faqs = [
  { q: "Is MedMethod Direct licensed to practice in Pennsylvania?", a: "Yes. MedMethod Direct is fully licensed to practice medicine in Pennsylvania. Our board-certified physicians are authorized to evaluate, prescribe, and manage hormone therapy and medical weight loss programs for patients throughout the Commonwealth — including Pittsburgh — entirely via telehealth, with no in-person visit required." },
  { q: "Do I need to visit an office to become a patient in Pittsburgh?", a: "No. MedMethod Direct is a 100% virtual practice. Everything — your consultation, lab review, prescription, and ongoing check-ins — happens online via secure video. Your medication ships directly from a licensed 503B compounding pharmacy to your Pittsburgh address." },
  { q: "Why do Pittsburgh women choose MedMethod Direct over UPMC specialists?", a: "UPMC is one of the largest and most respected health systems in the country, but its endocrinology and women's health departments are heavily booked. Women in Shadyside, Fox Chapel, and the South Hills often wait months for a specialist appointment focused on perimenopause or hormone therapy. MedMethod Direct offers same-week consultations with physicians who specialize specifically in women's hormonal health and GLP-1 weight loss — without the UPMC wait times." },
  { q: "Does MedMethod Direct serve Pittsburgh's affluent neighborhoods?", a: "Yes. MedMethod Direct serves patients across the entire Pittsburgh metro, including Shadyside, Fox Chapel, Mt. Lebanon, Upper St. Clair, and Sewickley. Because we are 100% virtual, your neighborhood within the metro area does not affect access — you receive the same physician-led care regardless of where you live in the Pittsburgh region." },
  { q: "What services does MedMethod Direct offer Pittsburgh patients?", a: "We offer bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT), GLP-1 medical weight loss (semaglutide and tirzepatide), perimenopause and menopause management, and testosterone optimization. All programs are personalized based on your lab results and health history, with ongoing physician oversight included." },

  {
    q: "What makes MedMethod Direct different from other telehealth services?",
    a: "Most telehealth services ship you a box and disappear. MedMethod Direct provides a more responsible, doctor-led path \u2014 starting with comprehensive labs and a deep-dive diagnostic to build a fully customized plan. We meet with you virtually every two weeks to complete a weigh-in, closely track your progress, and provide personalized recommendations. You'll work with the same doctor and the same dedicated Wellness Advisor throughout your entire journey.",
  },
  {
    q: "I'm a woman over 40 and feel like my body is working against me. Can you help?",
    a: "Yes \u2014 this is exactly who we're built for. Night sweats, brain fog, mood swings, hormonal weight gain, low energy, low libido \u2014 these are not just 'part of aging.' They're symptoms of hormonal imbalance that can be addressed with the right clinical approach. We start with comprehensive labs to find the real answers, then build a personalized plan to help you feel like yourself again.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does the process look like from start to finish?",
    a: "It starts with a free virtual consultation with one of our board-certified physicians. Then we order comprehensive lab work at a local lab near you. Once we have your results, your doctor builds a fully customized treatment protocol, personalized nutrition program, and custom fitness plan. After that, we meet with you virtually every two weeks to track progress and adjust your plan. You'll always work with the same doctor and Wellness Advisor.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is this different from just getting a prescription online?",
    a: "We don't just prescribe and disappear. Our approach includes comprehensive diagnostics, a personalized multi-faceted plan (treatment + nutrition + fitness), bi-weekly check-ins with your doctor, ongoing monitoring and adjustments, and a dedicated Wellness Advisor who supports you every step of the way. We treat the whole person, not just a symptom.",
  },
  {
    q: "What kind of lab work do you order?",
    a: "We order comprehensive panels that go far beyond what most primary care physicians check. This includes full hormone panels (estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, DHEA, cortisol), thyroid function, metabolic markers, inflammatory markers, vitamin levels, and more. This deep-dive diagnostic is what allows us to build a truly personalized plan \u2014 not a guess.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is everything done virtually?",
    a: "Yes \u2014 all consultations, follow-ups, and ongoing care are conducted via telehealth. You'll complete lab work at a local lab near you (we'll provide the order), and your medications (FDA-approved brand or compounded from a licensed 503B outsourcing pharmacy) and supplements are shipped directly to your home. No waiting rooms, no commuting, no disruption to your schedule.",
  },
  {
    q: "How quickly will I see results?",
    a: "Many patients report noticeable improvements in sleep, energy, and mood within 4\u20136 weeks of starting treatment. Optimal hormone balance typically occurs at the 3\u20136 month mark. Weight loss results vary, but most patients see meaningful progress within the first 4\u20138 weeks, especially when the nutrition and fitness plan is followed alongside medical treatment.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you use FDA-approved medications or compounded ones?",
    a: "Both \u2014 and the distinction matters. FDA-approved brand-name medications like Ozempic\u00ae, Wegovy\u00ae, Mounjaro\u00ae, and Zepbound\u00ae have undergone full FDA review for safety and efficacy. Compounded medications use the same active ingredients (Semaglutide or Tirzepatide) but are prepared by a licensed 503B outsourcing facility \u2014 a federally registered, FDA-inspected pharmacy held to strict quality and sterility standards. Compounded options are often more affordable and allow for custom dosing. Your physician will discuss both options during your consultation and recommend the best fit based on your insurance, budget, and clinical needs. Either way, your medication ships directly to your door.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does treatment cost?",
    a: "We offer transparent, flat-rate pricing with no hidden fees. Your free consultation will include a full breakdown of pricing for your personalized plan. We offer flexible payment options and accept HSA/FSA. We believe premium, personalized care should be accessible \u2014 and we're committed to being upfront about every cost.",
  },
  ...pricingFaqs,
  {
    q: "Do you accept insurance?",
    a: "MedMethod Direct is a cash-pay practice. We do not bill insurance directly. Many patients use HSA or FSA funds, and we provide detailed receipts that can be submitted for potential out-of-network reimbursement. We're happy to provide documentation to support that process.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you prescribe brand-name GLP-1 medications so I can use my insurance at the pharmacy?",
    a: "Yes \u2014 we can write prescriptions for brand-name medications (Ozempic\u00ae, Wegovy\u00ae, Mounjaro\u00ae, Zepbound\u00ae) that you can take to your pharmacy and attempt to run through your insurance. However, most insurance plans either exclude GLP-1s for weight loss entirely, or require prior authorization. If your plan requires a prior authorization, we can complete one for an additional fee \u2014 but please be aware that if it is denied, we do not complete appeals. In many cases, compounded semaglutide or tirzepatide from our licensed 503B pharmacy is more affordable and ships directly to your door without the insurance process. Your physician will walk you through both options during your consultation.",

              If you live in Pittsburgh and you've been searching for a{" "}
              <strong>menopause doctor near Pittsburgh, PA</strong>, a{" "}
              <strong>medical weight loss physician serving Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</strong>, or a hormone specialist who treats the whole picture — you've found the right place.

            </p>
            <p>
              We specialize in the full spectrum of women's metabolic and hormonal health:{" "}

              <strong>bioidentical hormone therapy (BHRT)</strong>,{" "}

            </p>
            <p>
              Whether you're experiencing{" "}
              <strong>perimenopause weight gain</strong>, brain fog, night sweats, low libido, or you've tried GLP-1s elsewhere and hit a plateau — the missing piece is almost always hormonal. MedMethod Direct is one of the only virtual practices in Pennsylvania that addresses <strong>weight loss and hormone balance together</strong>, in a single physician-led program.
