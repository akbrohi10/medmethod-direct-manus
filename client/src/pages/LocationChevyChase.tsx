const faqs = [
  { q: "Is there a menopause doctor near Chevy Chase, MD?", a: "Yes. MedMethod Direct is a virtual menopause and hormone clinic licensed in Maryland, serving women in Chevy Chase, Bethesda, Potomac, and throughout Montgomery County. All care is 100% virtual — Dr. Jumana Al-Deek, DO, can typically see new patients within days of your free consultation." },
  { q: "Can I get semaglutide or tirzepatide prescribed online near Chevy Chase, Maryland?", a: "Yes. Dr. Al-Deek prescribes both FDA-approved GLP-1 medications (Ozempic®, Wegovy®, Mounjaro®, Zepbound®) and compounded semaglutide and tirzepatide to patients in Chevy Chase and Montgomery County. Bloodwork is ordered to a LabCorp or Quest Diagnostics near you. Medications are shipped directly to your door." },
  { q: "Do I need to come in for bloodwork near Chevy Chase?", a: "No office visit to MedMethod Direct is ever required. Chevy Chase and Bethesda have excellent lab density — LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics locations throughout the area. We order your labs, you go in for the draw, and results come directly to Dr. Al-Deek." },
  { q: "What is bioidentical hormone therapy (BHRT) and is it available near Chevy Chase?", a: "BHRT uses hormones molecularly identical to those your body produces — typically estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone. MedMethod Direct offers both FDA-approved bioidentical hormones and compounded BHRT formulations, prescribed based on comprehensive lab testing and shipped to your Chevy Chase address." },
  { q: "How is MedMethod Direct different from other telehealth platforms?", a: "MedMethod Direct is a physician-led program, not a subscription service. Dr. Al-Deek personally reviews your labs, builds a protocol specific to your biology, and remains your physician for the full 6 or 12-month program. We also integrate hormone therapy and weight loss into a single program — rather than treating each issue separately." },
  { q: "Can MedMethod Direct also serve patients in McLean or Great Falls, Virginia?", a: "Yes. MedMethod Direct is licensed in both Maryland and Virginia. Chevy Chase sits directly on the DC border, and many patients have family or colleagues in nearby McLean and Great Falls, VA — we serve both communities under the same physician-led program." },
  ...pricingFaqs,
  { q: "Does MedMethod Direct accept insurance?", a: "MedMethod Direct is a cash-pay practice. We do not bill insurance directly. Many patients use HSA or FSA funds, and we provide detailed receipts that can be submitted for potential out-of-network reimbursement." },
  { q: "Can you prescribe brand-name GLP-1 medications so I can use my insurance at the pharmacy?", a: "Yes — we can write prescriptions for brand-name medications (Ozempic®, Wegovy®, Mounjaro®, Zepbound®) that you can take to your pharmacy and attempt to run through your insurance. However, most insurance plans either exclude GLP-1s for weight loss entirely, or require prior authorization. If your plan requires a prior authorization, we can complete one for an additional fee — but please be aware that if it is denied, we do not complete appeals. In many cases, compounded semaglutide or tirzepatide from our licensed 503B pharmacy is more affordable and ships directly to your door without the insurance process." },
  { q: "What does the $449 Clinical Diagnostic & Setup Fee include?", a: "The $449 fee covers your comprehensive initial bloodwork (hormone panel, metabolic panel, thyroid), your first physician consultation with Dr. Al-Deek, a smart scale for tracking body composition, and access to a personalized fitness and nutrition app. This one-time fee is separate from your monthly program fee." },

  {
    q: "What makes MedMethod Direct different from other telehealth services?",
    a: "Most telehealth services ship you a box and disappear. MedMethod Direct provides a more responsible, doctor-led path \u2014 starting with comprehensive labs and a deep-dive diagnostic to build a fully customized plan. We meet with you virtually every two weeks to complete a weigh-in, closely track your progress, and provide personalized recommendations. You'll work with the same doctor and the same dedicated Wellness Advisor throughout your entire journey.",
  },
  {
    q: "I'm a woman over 40 and feel like my body is working against me. Can you help?",
    a: "Yes \u2014 this is exactly who we're built for. Night sweats, brain fog, mood swings, hormonal weight gain, low energy, low libido \u2014 these are not just 'part of aging.' They're symptoms of hormonal imbalance that can be addressed with the right clinical approach. We start with comprehensive labs to find the real answers, then build a personalized plan to help you feel like yourself again.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does the process look like from start to finish?",
    a: "It starts with a free virtual consultation with one of our board-certified physicians. Then we order comprehensive lab work at a local lab near you. Once we have your results, your doctor builds a fully customized treatment protocol, personalized nutrition program, and custom fitness plan. After that, we meet with you virtually every two weeks to track progress and adjust your plan. You'll always work with the same doctor and Wellness Advisor.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is this different from just getting a prescription online?",
    a: "We don't just prescribe and disappear. Our approach includes comprehensive diagnostics, a personalized multi-faceted plan (treatment + nutrition + fitness), bi-weekly check-ins with your doctor, ongoing monitoring and adjustments, and a dedicated Wellness Advisor who supports you every step of the way. We treat the whole person, not just a symptom.",
  },
  {
    q: "What kind of lab work do you order?",
    a: "We order comprehensive panels that go far beyond what most primary care physicians check. This includes full hormone panels (estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, DHEA, cortisol), thyroid function, metabolic markers, inflammatory markers, vitamin levels, and more. This deep-dive diagnostic is what allows us to build a truly personalized plan \u2014 not a guess.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is everything done virtually?",
    a: "Yes \u2014 all consultations, follow-ups, and ongoing care are conducted via telehealth. You'll complete lab work at a local lab near you (we'll provide the order), and your medications (FDA-approved brand or compounded from a licensed 503B outsourcing pharmacy) and supplements are shipped directly to your home. No waiting rooms, no commuting, no disruption to your schedule.",
  },
  {
    q: "How quickly will I see results?",
    a: "Many patients report noticeable improvements in sleep, energy, and mood within 4\u20136 weeks of starting treatment. Optimal hormone balance typically occurs at the 3\u20136 month mark. Weight loss results vary, but most patients see meaningful progress within the first 4\u20138 weeks, especially when the nutrition and fitness plan is followed alongside medical treatment.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you use FDA-approved medications or compounded ones?",
    a: "Both \u2014 and the distinction matters. FDA-approved brand-name medications like Ozempic\u00ae, Wegovy\u00ae, Mounjaro\u00ae, and Zepbound\u00ae have undergone full FDA review for safety and efficacy. Compounded medications use the same active ingredients (Semaglutide or Tirzepatide) but are prepared by a licensed 503B outsourcing facility \u2014 a federally registered, FDA-inspected pharmacy held to strict quality and sterility standards. Compounded options are often more affordable and allow for custom dosing. Your physician will discuss both options during your consultation and recommend the best fit based on your insurance, budget, and clinical needs. Either way, your medication ships directly to your door.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does treatment cost?",
    a: "We offer transparent, flat-rate pricing with no hidden fees. Your free consultation will include a full breakdown of pricing for your personalized plan. We offer flexible payment options and accept HSA/FSA. We believe premium, personalized care should be accessible \u2014 and we're committed to being upfront about every cost.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you accept insurance?",
    a: "MedMethod Direct is a cash-pay practice. We do not bill insurance directly. Many patients use HSA or FSA funds, and we provide detailed receipts that can be submitted for potential out-of-network reimbursement. We're happy to provide documentation to support that process.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you prescribe brand-name GLP-1 medications so I can use my insurance at the pharmacy?",
    a: "Yes \u2014 we can write prescriptions for brand-name medications (Ozempic\u00ae, Wegovy\u00ae, Mounjaro\u00ae, Zepbound\u00ae) that you can take to your pharmacy and attempt to run through your insurance. However, most insurance plans either exclude GLP-1s for weight loss entirely, or require prior authorization. If your plan requires a prior authorization, we can complete one for an additional fee \u2014 but please be aware that if it is denied, we do not complete appeals.

Your physician will walk you through both options during your consultation.",

              If you've been searching for a <strong>menopause doctor near Chevy Chase MD</strong> or a <strong>bioidentical hormone therapy specialist in Montgomery County</strong>, MedMethod Direct was built for you. Chevy Chase has one of the highest household incomes in Maryland — and almost no telehealth competition. The women here have access to the best of everything, but specialist-level virtual hormone care has been largely absent.
            </p>
            <p>
              Led by <strong>Dr. Jumana Al-Deek, DO</strong>, MedMethod Direct offers <strong>perimenopause and menopause management</strong>, <strong>bioidentical hormone therapy (BHRT)</strong>, <strong>testosterone therapy for women</strong>, and <strong>physician-prescribed semaglutide and tirzepatide</strong> — all in one integrated virtual program. Labs ordered to <strong>LabCorp or Quest Diagnostics near Chevy Chase or Bethesda</strong>. Medications shipped to your door.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chevy Chase sits directly on the DC border — and MedMethod Direct is licensed in both Maryland and Virginia, making us the natural choice for women in this corridor. Whether you're in Chevy Chase Section 5, the Village, or the DC side of the line, we serve you under the same physician-led program.
