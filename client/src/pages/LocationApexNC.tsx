const faqs = [
  {
    q: "Why do Apex women choose MedMethod Direct?",
    a: "Apex has been named one of the best places to live in America, and its residents expect premium care. Yet despite being part of the Research Triangle, Apex women often face long waits — 3 to 6 months — to see a hormone specialist in Raleigh or Cary. MedMethod Direct offers same-week virtual appointments with board-certified physicians, with all medications shipped directly to your Apex home.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is MedMethod Direct licensed to prescribe in North Carolina?",
    a: "Yes. MedMethod Direct is fully licensed to practice medicine in North Carolina and prescribe medications to patients throughout the state, including Apex and Wake County. All prescriptions are fulfilled through an FDA-registered 503B compounding pharmacy.",
  },
  {
    q: "What treatments are available to Apex women?",
    a: "We specialize in bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT), perimenopause and menopause management, medical weight loss with semaglutide and tirzepatide (GLP-1), thyroid optimization, and longevity protocols. Every plan is personalized based on your comprehensive lab results.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does virtual care work for hormone therapy?",
    a: "North Carolina law allows licensed physicians to evaluate, diagnose, and prescribe medications via secure video without an in-person visit. After your consultation, your prescription is sent to a compounding pharmacy and shipped to your Apex address, typically within 3–5 business days.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does getting started cost?",
    a: "The initial diagnostic setup is $449, covering a comprehensive hormone and metabolic lab panel plus a physician consultation. Ongoing memberships are available in 6 or 12-month commitments with transparent monthly pricing.",
  },

  {
    q: "What makes MedMethod Direct different from other telehealth services?",
    a: "Most telehealth services ship you a box and disappear. MedMethod Direct provides a more responsible, doctor-led path \u2014 starting with comprehensive labs and a deep-dive diagnostic to build a fully customized plan. We meet with you virtually every two weeks to complete a weigh-in, closely track your progress, and provide personalized recommendations. You'll work with the same doctor and the same dedicated Performance Coach throughout your entire journey.",
  },
  {
    q: "I'm a woman over 40 and feel like my body is working against me. Can you help?",
    a: "Yes \u2014 this is exactly who we're built for. Night sweats, brain fog, mood swings, hormonal weight gain, low energy, low libido \u2014 these are not just 'part of aging.' They're symptoms of hormonal imbalance that can be addressed with the right clinical approach. We start with comprehensive labs to find the real answers, then build a personalized plan to help you feel like yourself again.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does the process look like from start to finish?",
    a: "It starts with a free virtual consultation with one of our board-certified physicians. Then we order comprehensive lab work at a local lab near you. Once we have your results, your doctor builds a fully customized treatment protocol, personalized nutrition program, and custom fitness plan. After that, we meet with you virtually every two weeks to track progress and adjust your plan. You'll always work with the same doctor and Performance Coach.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is this different from just getting a prescription online?",
    a: "We don't just prescribe and disappear. Our approach includes comprehensive diagnostics, a personalized multi-faceted plan (treatment + nutrition + fitness), bi-weekly check-ins with your doctor, ongoing monitoring and adjustments, and a dedicated Performance Coach who supports you every step of the way. We treat the whole person, not just a symptom.",
  },
  {
    q: "What kind of lab work do you order?",
    a: "We order comprehensive panels that go far beyond what most primary care physicians check. This includes full hormone panels (estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, DHEA, cortisol), thyroid function, metabolic markers, inflammatory markers, vitamin levels, and more. This deep-dive diagnostic is what allows us to build a truly personalized plan \u2014 not a guess.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is everything done virtually?",
    a: "Yes \u2014 all consultations, follow-ups, and ongoing care are conducted via telehealth. You'll complete lab work at a local lab near you (we'll provide the order), and your medications (FDA-approved brand or compounded from a licensed 503B outsourcing pharmacy) and supplements are shipped directly to your home. No waiting rooms, no commuting, no disruption to your schedule.",
  },
  {
    q: "How quickly will I see results?",
    a: "Many patients report noticeable improvements in sleep, energy, and mood within 4\u20136 weeks of starting treatment. Optimal hormone balance typically occurs at the 3\u20136 month mark. Weight loss results vary, but most patients see meaningful progress within the first 4\u20138 weeks, especially when the nutrition and fitness plan is followed alongside medical treatment.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you use FDA-approved medications or compounded ones?",
    a: "Both \u2014 and the distinction matters. FDA-approved brand-name medications like Ozempic\u00ae, Wegovy\u00ae, Mounjaro\u00ae, and Zepbound\u00ae have undergone full FDA review for safety and efficacy. Compounded medications use the same active ingredients (Semaglutide or Tirzepatide) but are prepared by a licensed 503B outsourcing facility \u2014 a federally registered, FDA-inspected pharmacy held to strict quality and sterility standards. Compounded options are often more affordable and allow for custom dosing. Your physician will discuss both options during your consultation and recommend the best fit based on your insurance, budget, and clinical needs. Either way, your medication ships directly to your door.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is pricing structured?",
    a: "We offer transparent, flat-rate pricing with no hidden fees. Your appointment will include a full breakdown of pricing for your personalized plan. We offer flexible payment options and accept HSA/FSA. We believe premium, personalized care should be accessible \u2014 and we're committed to being upfront about every cost.",
  },
  ...pricingFaqs,
  {
    q: "Do you accept insurance?",
    a: "MedMethod Direct is a cash-pay practice. We do not bill insurance directly. Many patients use HSA or FSA funds, and we provide detailed receipts that can be submitted for potential out-of-network reimbursement. We're happy to provide documentation to support that process.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you prescribe brand-name GLP-1 medications so I can use my insurance at the pharmacy?",
    a: "Yes \u2014 we can write prescriptions for brand-name medications (Ozempic\u00ae, Wegovy\u00ae, Mounjaro\u00ae, Zepbound\u00ae) that you can take to your pharmacy and attempt to run through your insurance. However, most insurance plans either exclude GLP-1s for weight loss entirely, or require prior authorization. If your plan requires a prior authorization, we can complete one for an additional fee \u2014 but please be aware that if it is denied, we do not complete appeals. In many cases, compounded semaglutide or tirzepatide from our licensed 503B pharmacy is more affordable and ships directly to your door without the insurance process. Your physician will walk you through both options during your consultation.",

            <p>
              We specialize in the full spectrum of women's metabolic and hormonal health: <strong>perimenopause and menopause management</strong>, <strong>hormone replacement therapy (HRT)</strong>, <strong>bioidentical hormone therapy (BHRT)</strong>, <strong>testosterone optimization for women</strong>, GLP-1 medications including <strong>compounded semaglutide and tirzepatide</strong>, insulin resistance, thyroid optimization, and longevity-focused care, all managed virtually by Dr. Jumana Al-Deek, DO.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether you are experiencing <strong>perimenopause weight gain</strong>, brain fog, night sweats, low libido, or you have tried GLP-1s elsewhere and hit a plateau, the missing piece is almost always hormonal. MedMethod Direct is one of the few virtual practices in North Carolina that addresses <strong>weight loss and hormone balance together</strong>, in a single physician-led program. Women in Apex no longer need to drive to Raleigh or Cary for specialist care.
