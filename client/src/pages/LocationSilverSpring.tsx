const faqs = [
  { q: "Is there a menopause doctor near Silver Spring, MD?", a: "Yes. MedMethod Direct is a virtual menopause and hormone clinic licensed in Maryland, serving women in Silver Spring, Wheaton, Takoma Park, and throughout Montgomery County. All care is 100% virtual — Dr. Jumana Al-Deek, DO, can typically see new patients within days of your appointment." },
  { q: "Can I get semaglutide or tirzepatide prescribed online near Silver Spring, Maryland?", a: "Yes. After reviewing your health history and clinical needs, Dr. Al-Deek can prescribe an appropriate medication when indicated. Medication selection, pharmacy fulfillment, and insurance considerations are discussed during your visit. If a compounded medication is considered, it is not FDA-approved, and FDA does not review compounded drugs for safety, effectiveness, or quality before marketing." },
  { q: "Do I need to come in for bloodwork near Silver Spring?", a: "No office visit to MedMethod Direct is ever required. Silver Spring has excellent lab access — multiple LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics locations throughout the area. We order your labs, you go in for the draw, and results come directly to Dr. Al-Deek." },
  { q: "How is MedMethod Direct different from local practices in Silver Spring?", a: "Silver Spring has established in-person practices — but even the best local providers offer 10–15 minute appointments and 4–8 week waits for new patients. MedMethod Direct offers 30–60 minute appointments, same-week availability, and a virtual program that treats hormones and GLP-1 weight loss as a single clinical problem." },
  { q: "Can MedMethod Direct also serve patients in Washington, DC?", a: "MedMethod Direct is currently licensed in Maryland and Virginia. Silver Spring sits directly on the DC border — many of our Silver Spring patients also have colleagues or family in DC. We are actively working toward DC licensure. In the meantime, patients who live in Silver Spring but work in DC are fully served under our Maryland license." },
  ...pricingFaqs,
  { q: "Does MedMethod Direct accept insurance?", a: "MedMethod Direct is a cash-pay practice. We do not bill insurance directly. Many patients use HSA or FSA funds, and we provide detailed receipts that can be submitted for potential out-of-network reimbursement." },
  {
    q: "I'm a woman over 40 and feel like my body is working against me. Can you help?",
    a: "Yes \u2014 this is exactly who we're built for. Night sweats, brain fog, mood swings, hormonal weight gain, low energy, low libido \u2014 these are not just 'part of aging.' They're symptoms of hormonal imbalance that can be addressed with the right clinical approach. We start with comprehensive labs to find the real answers, then build a personalized plan to help you feel like yourself again.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is everything done virtually?",
    a: "Yes — consultations, follow-ups, and ongoing care are conducted through secure telehealth. You may complete ordered lab work at a local lab, and any medication prescribed by your physician will be fulfilled through an appropriate pharmacy. No waiting rooms, commuting, or unnecessary disruption to your schedule.",
  },
  {
    q: "How quickly will I see results?",
    a: "Responses to treatment vary. Dr. Al-Deek will monitor your symptoms, laboratory findings, medication response, and goals and will adjust your plan when clinically appropriate.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you use FDA-approved medications or compounded ones?",
    a: "Medication selection is individualized and based on your health history, clinical needs, and treatment goals. If a compounded medication is clinically appropriate, Dr. Al-Deek will explain why it is being considered, available alternatives, expected costs, and pharmacy fulfillment before you decide how to proceed. Compounded medications are not FDA-approved, and FDA does not review compounded drugs for safety, effectiveness, or quality before marketing.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is pricing structured?",
    a: "We offer transparent, flat-rate pricing with no hidden fees. Your appointment will include a full breakdown of pricing for your personalized plan. We offer flexible payment options and accept HSA/FSA. We believe premium, personalized care should be accessible \u2014 and we're committed to being upfront about every cost.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you accept insurance?",
    a: "MedMethod Direct is a cash-pay practice. We do not bill insurance directly. Many patients use HSA or FSA funds, and we provide detailed receipts that can be submitted for potential out-of-network reimbursement. We're happy to provide documentation to support that process.",
